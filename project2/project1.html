<h3>Objectives</h3>

<ul>
<li>Get used to building C++ programs in our UBC environment.</li>
<li>Work through the details of stack and queue implementations.</li>
<li>Understand depth-first-search (DFS) and breadth-first-search (BFS).</li>
<li>Solve some fun puzzles!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
Stacks and queues are powerful tools for storing and accessing
data. In particular, these data structures are at the heart of two of
the most important algorithms in computer science: depth first search
(DFS) and breadth first search (BFS).
<!--
Priority Queues are slightly
more complicated and slightly less common, but are also widely used.
In our project, they are used to implement the heuristic-based best-first search
(BestFS) algorithm.
-->
</p>

<p>
Searching is an extremely general approach to solving problems.
We systematically explore possible solutions until we find
one that works.  Thanks to the speed of the computer (and efficient
algorithms like what you learn in 221!), search is able to solve
a wide range of important, practical problems.  In this project (and
the next one),
we'll develop some reusable code that lets us solve a wide
range of puzzles, with only a small amount of coding needed
to add a new puzzle type.</p>

<p>
Of course, these are all just fun puzzles, but similar approaches
have solved problems like route-finding in mapping systems or
providing responsive control for space probes too far from Earth for
direct control (among <strong>many</strong> others).
</p>

<p>
For starters, we are providing you
with code to solve the
classic
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox,_goose_and_bag_of_beans_puzzle"> Wolf-Goat-Cabbage problem</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku">Sudoku</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peg_solitaire">Peg Solitaire</a>,
and the general <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_puzzle">Slider Puzzle</a>
of which the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifteen_puzzle">15-puzzle</a>
is the most famous variant.
We've also given you a simple maze explorer, to help you visualize
the different search algorithms.
We may add a few more puzzles if we have time.
</p>

<p>
(If you are unfamiliar with these puzzles, there are many on-line implementations.
Here's <a href="http://mypuzzle.org/sliding">one for the sliding puzzles</a>,
<a href="http://www.websudoku.com/">one for Sudoku</a>,
and <a href="http://www.neok12.com/games/peg-solitaire/peg-solitaire.htm">
one for peg solitaire</a>.  BTW, beware of spending too much time playing
the puzzles!)
</p>

<p>
DFS involves following a sequence of moves as far
as we can go, until we get stuck.
When this occurs, the search backtracks to its most recent choice and
tries a different path instead.
</p>

<p>
BFS proceeds differently: it tries moves in order of their discovery,
beginning at the starting point of the search.  First it tries all
moves available from the starting point, then it tries all moves
available starting from where those first moves end, i.e., &quot;two
steps away&quot;.  It continues in the same fashion from there until a
solution is found.  Because of this, BFS has the nice property that it
will discover the shortest path to a solution, in terms of the number
of moves taken to reach the solution.  (It has the nasty property that
it will visit every closer state of the puzzle along the way.)
</p>

<!--
<p>
Best First Search uses a function that assigns a priority or quality to each
state.
It explores the state that is one step away from a previously explored state
that is the most promising or highest priority.
This hopefully helps guide the search to explore possibilities that
are more likely to lead to a solution quickly.
</p>
-->

<p>
The algorithms for DFS and BFS work very
similarly, but they are based on different data structures.
DFS is based on a stack, because you're always returning to the most
recent choice you made (so it's last-in-first-out); and BFS is based on
a queue, because you are always exploring states in the order in which
you discover them (first-in-first-out).
Let's use "bag" to refer to the "stack" or "queue", so
we can use 
"put in " to refer to the operation that puts something into the bag: "push",
or "enqueue";
and we'll use
"take out" to refer to the operation that takes something out of
the bag: "pop", or "dequeue".
Now we can describe DFS and BFS using the same algorithm.
</p>

<p>
Both algorithms begin by adding the initial puzzle state
to the bag of active states.
Then, until the bag is empty or a solution is found,
they take a state out of the bag.  If that state has not
already been explored (i.e., previously removed from the bag),
they find the possible next states (after one move) and put each one of these
children into the bag.
</p>

<p>
Note that except in special cases (like Sudoku), we need a second
data structure in addition to the bag.  This is a dictionary ADT
(which we'll study soon in the course)
that keeps track of what states we have explored during our search.  We don't
want the algorithm to re-explore any state (this wastes effort and might lead
to infinite loops).
In addition, for many puzzles, we don't want to see just the solution;
we also want to see the sequence of moves that led from the initial
state to the solution.  If we use the dictionary to store for
each state the parent state from which we arrived at the state,
then once we find a solution, we can follow these parents backwards
and find the sequence of states that led to the solution.  Note that
this dictionary will be used <b>a LOT</b> during the search, so it
should be efficient.
</p>


<h3>Assignment</h3> 

<p>
Note that this assignment has two stages:  a <b>Milestone</b>, which
is due earlier, and the <b>Final Submission</b>.
The milestone is meant to be easy, but it requires you to get the files
and get them to compile and run, which can sometimes take a <b>long</b>
time if you run into technical difficulties.
<b>So be sure to get started as soon as possible, so you can
get help if needed!</b>  Directions for what and how to submit your
milestone and final submission are below.
(Why this milestone?  Because in the past,
a lot of folks waited until so late that they never managed to compile
the code in time, and they ended up getting zeroes on the assignment!)
</p>
<p>
For this assignment, you will try solving puzzles with
the active states bag being a stack or a queue.
We have provided two implementations of the
stack ADT (which you can use as examples to help you with
your programming).  You must implement the queue ADT using
a circular array (and supporting dynamic resizing) as well as using
a linked list.
</p>

<p>
You will use your implementations, and the ones that we have supplied,
to experiment with solving a variety of puzzles.
In particular, you will test your code by using the
supplied <code>solve.cpp</code> program, along with its associated files.
(However, note that just as you were taught in 110 and 210, it's important
that your code actually implement the Queue ADT, so you should write
your own unit tests.)
</p><p>
You also must answer some questions in the MILESTONE1.txt and
HANDIN.txt files.
</p><p>
<strong>Important implementation constraints:</strong> In your
circular array queue implementation, you must use regular C++ arrays.
You <strong>may not</strong> use
<code>std::vector</code> or other classes that directly support
resizing. (We want you to learn how to do it yourself!)  We have
provided a simple, bare-bones linked-list node type and an example of
using it in the LinkedListStack implementation.  You are free to use
this for LinkedListQueue, or you may implement your own linked list
structure. You may <strong>not</strong> use
<code>std::list</code> (which is implemented as a linked list) or any
other linked list libraries.
<!--
For the priority queue, you <strong>may
not</strong> use <code>std::priority_queue</code> or any other heap
implementations; you must implement your own. However, you are allowed
(and strongly encouraged) to use <code>std::vector</code> in your heap
implementation to make resizing the heap easy.
-->
</p><p>

<strong>Important marking constraints:</strong> We will mark your code
semi-automatically.  Therefore, you must ensure that your code will
compile and link correctly by simply running <code>make</code> on the
ugrad Linux servers, <b>with our supplied Makefile</b>.
Also, your code <b>must respect the supplied interface types,
with no modifications</b>.

</p><p>

You are responsible for deallocating any memory that you
allocate.  (The rule of thumb is: if you create something
with <code>new</code>, you should destroy it with <code>delete</code>
when you've finished with it.  If you used <code>new</code> with
brackets to make an array, use <code>delete []</code> rather than
just <code>delete</code>.)

</p><p>

<b>Teams</b>
</p><p> 

You may work on a team of at most two on this assignment, subject to
the course's <a href="../syllabus.shtml#conduct">Academic Conduct
policy</a>, and we <strong>strongly</strong> encourage that you do so. We
recommend that you work (literally) together as much as
possible. You must: (1) document each team member's effort in
the <code>HANDIN.txt</code> file; (2) work together on
and <em>both</em> understand your <code>HANDIN.txt</code>; (3)
understand how your team's code is structured and why it
works. Remember to test your team's code as an integrated whole!
Except in extreme cases, all team members will receive the same grade
for the project.  Check

I Need to Know about Pair Programming I Learned in Kindergarten</a>

<b>What we've provided</b>
</p><p>
As a starting point we've provided some files:
    </p><dl>
    <dt><u>Makefile</u></dt>

    <dd><!-- (This, and much of this write-up, is courtesy of Steve Wolfman.) -->
    The command <code>make</code> will use this to build your
    program. You <strong>should not need</strong> to modify the
    makefile, even if you add new <code>.cpp</code>
    and <code>.hpp</code> files.  <strong>DO NOT MISS</strong> the
    following commands: 
    <code>make handin-milestone1</code> hands in your Milestone.
    Run it early and
    often so you're not late.
    <code>make
    handin-proj1</code> hands in your final project 1 submission (run
    early and often).  <b>These commands must be executed on our
    undergrad linux servers, in a directory that contains the
    Makefile, and
    the relevant MILESTONE1.txt, HANDIN.txt, and various .cpp and .hpp
    files you wish to hand in.</b></dd>



    <dt><u>MILESTONE1.txt, HANDIN.txt</u></dt>

    <dd>Key documentation files for your milestone and final submissions.  Read
      these and fill in the TODO items!  Also, answer the questions there.</dd>


    <dt><u>solve.cpp</u></dt>

    <dd>This is the main code that solves the puzzles.
    You will edit this code to choose what kind of puzzle to solve,
    set up the initial configuration, and select which search strategy
    and dictionary implementation to use.
    Initially, <strong>you'll just make a few changes to it to
    explore the different search algorithms</strong>.
    Later, you'll <strong>alter it so it uses your
    data structures rather than ours</strong>.</dd>

    <dt><u>BagOfPuzzleStates.hpp</u></dt>

    <dd>This defines the abstract type which your stack and queue
    must implement. You can look at the provided
    implementations of the ArrayStack and LinkedListStack
    to see how to do this. <strong>Your
    queue, and priority queue classes must be subclasses of
    BagOfPuzzleStates</strong>.<!--  (Feel free to add layers of abstraction that
    group the queues, stacks, and priority queues if you'd like.)--></dd>
	<dd><strong>Warning</strong>: Don't go about inserting logic for
	  depth-first, breadth-first, or best-first search into your code.
	  It's entirely unnecessary.
	The searches use the *same* algorithm; the only difference is a
	different underlying data structure for the active states. </dd>

    <dt><u>ArrayStack.hpp, ArrayStack.cpp</u></dt>

    <dd>An implementation of a stack using a (resizable) array. Study
    it carefully and use it as a guide to implement the rest of your
    data structures! It will especially be useful for your array-based
    queue.</dd>
 	<dd><strong>Warning:</strong> your <code>ensure_capacity</code>
    for the queue will necessarily look somewhat different from the
    one in this file!  </dd>

    <dt><u>LinkedListStack.hpp, LinkedListStack.cpp</u></dt>

    <dd>An implementation of a stack using a linked list. Study it
    carefully and use it as a guide to implement the rest of your
    data structures! It will especially be useful for your linked-list
    queue.</dd>

    <dt><u>PredDict.hpp</u></dt>

    <dd>This defines the abstract type which the dictionary must
    implement.</dd>

    <dt><u>LinkedListDict.hpp, LinkedListDict.cpp</u></dt>

    <dd>A naive implementation of a dictionary that scans the
    list for each <code>find</code> operation.</dd>

    <dd>Skeleton code for the linked list queue files. <strong>Implement
    it!</strong></dd>

    <dt><u>ArrayQueue.hpp, ArrayQueue.cpp</u></dt>
    
    <dd>Skeleton code for an array-based queue class. <strong>Implement
    it!</strong></dd>
